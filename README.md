## Functionality

In this app, you're able to do a couple of things:

* Create an account

* Log in/out

* Create your own posts, which may contain text and an image (via image URL)

* View posts from other accounts

* Like posts

* View all posts you've liked

* Update your account's profile picture and bio

* Filter posts by user or content
